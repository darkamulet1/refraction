binding_notes:
  - `tests_binding` guides which sections must satisfy the golden outputs referenced in `docs/pyjhora_knowledge/tests_contract/PyJHora_Tests_Contract.json`.
  - Each suite should verify that the referenced outputs (e.g., “dashas”, “yogas”) include at least the fields expected by the roadmap (e.g., tithi/nakshatra, Vimshottari segments).
